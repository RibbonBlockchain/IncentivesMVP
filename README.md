About Us
------------  
Ribbon Blockchain is a healthcare incentives platform that aims to modify health and wellness behaviour through rewardable tasks.

Ribbon channels donated, pledged or sponsored funding directly to patients, community health workers and healthcare practitioners; where such funding is used to incentivize preventative care, adherence to medication and therapy, quality of care delivery and overall population health outcomes.

Our Incentives are distributed in DAI, an asset-backed, decentralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.

Features
------------

* **Ratings** : Our Patient Experience of Care (PEC) rating system enables patients to rate their healthcare experience to help identify areas for continuous improvement on the quality of healthcare delivery at both healthcare practitioner and healthcare institution level.

* **Incentives** : We offer tokenized incentives (paid in DAI) for any private or public health and wellness program or institution that needs to encourage preventative healthcare, disease screening and testing, quality of care delivery, adherence to therapy, disease suppression and behaviour change.

* **Analytics** : The Ribbon system generates Real-Time Data Analytics which allow healthcare institutions, practitioners, businesses and decision makers to get health insights, draw conclusions immediately and react to healthcare-related issues.

* **Decentralized** : Ribbon uses smart contracts and IPFS technology to decentralized the information storage to allow for better security and no upfront infrastructure costs.

* **Crowdfunding** : The DAO allows for transparency of funds from a donor or sponsor to the end user. That entire process is recorded and information is sent back to the donor.
The funds are first crowdfunded by a program, all of those funds go directly into the DAO and only get sent out to the people it's supposed to. Everything is tracked and if there's any malicious intent then a user will know and they can then report that program. The funds will be returned and the program will be deleted.

* **Ribbon Pay** : With Ribbon Pay, you can access crypto despite not having internet access or a smart device. Ribbon Pay uses USSD, SMS and Smart Contracts to enable seamless payment through all
